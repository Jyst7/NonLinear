# NonLinear

My attempt at a 5 axis printer for fun(pain and suffering)

NonLinear is an experimental project to develop a 5-axis 3D printer, moving beyond traditional 3-axis designs. The primary goal is to achieve higher precision and better surface quality on complex mechanical parts, particularly where traditional layer-by-layer printing falls short.

## Project Vision
- Create a 5-axis printer capable of true non-planar printing
- Enable printing of complex mechanical components without support structures
- Achieve superior surface finish on angled and curved surfaces
- Improve strength by aligning print layers with stress directions

## Current Development
- Researching current developments to use and improve on
- Investigating firmware requirements for 5-axis coordination
- Developing toolpath generation algorithms

## Technical Goals
1. Design and implement additional rotational axes
2. Create a toolpath generator for non-planar printing
3. Build a working prototype

## Why 5-Axis?
Traditional 3D printers are limited by their layer-by-layer approach, which can result in:
- Visible layer lines on curved surfaces
- Weak points between layers
- Extensive support material requirements
- Limited ability to create complex overhangs

A 5-axis system can address these limitations by allowing the nozzle to approach from any angle, following the natural contours of the part.
