# NonLinear

My attempt at a 5 axis printer for fun(pain and suffering)

NonLinear is an experimental project to develop a 5-axis 3D printer, moving beyond traditional 3-axis designs. The primary goal is to achieve higher precision and better surface quality on complex mechanical parts, particularly where traditional layer-by-layer printing falls short.

## Project Vision
- Create a 5-axis printer capable of true non-planar printing
- Enable printing of complex mechanical components without support structures
- Achieve superior surface finish on angled and curved surfaces
- Improve strength by aligning print layers with stress directions

## Current Development
- Researching current developments to use and improve on
- Small and fast printer that is stable

## Technical Goals
1. Create a toolpath generator for non-planar printing
2. Build a working prototype
